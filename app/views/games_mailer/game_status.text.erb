Werewolf Update: <%= @game.name %>
	
Hi <%= @user.username %> (or should I call you <%= @player.alias %>?),

Here's a update on your werewolf game:

<% if @game.turn > 0 %>
It is turn #<%= @game.turn %>, and it is <%= @game.state %>.
<% elsif @game.turn == 0 %>
The game has not yet started.
<% else %>
The game is over! 
<% end %>
<% if not @player.alive %>
Sorry, but you are DEAD.
<% end %>

<% if @game.started? %>
There are <%= @remaining_count.map  {|role, count| pluralize(count, role) }.to_sentence %> remaining.
<% elsif not @game.ready_to_start? %>
You need at least <%= @game.min_players - @game.players.count %> more players to start the game.
<% end %>

<% if @game.state == "finished" %>

	The <%= @game.winner %> have won!
